AI-Powered Image Similarity Search and Recommendation System
Problem Statement

In today's digital world, users struggle to find visually similar images using text-based search. This project aims to build an intelligent image similarity system using deep learning that can recommend similar images based purely on visual content.

Objective

Learn visual patterns from images using deep learning

Generate embeddings for images

Find and recommend visually similar images from a dataset

Support scalable and fast similarity search

Approach

The system uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract feature vectors (embeddings) from images. These embeddings are compared using cosine similarity to find the most similar images. The project is designed to be extendable using Triplet Loss and Triplet Networks for better metric learning.

Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow / PyTorch

OpenCV

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Current Status

Initial repository setup. Code and implementation will be added in subsequent updates.

Future Scope

Implement Triplet Network with Triplet Loss

Improve accuracy using better datasets

Build a web interface for image upload and search

Optimize for large-scale datasets
